                    In 2014, my battle with breast cancer began.  With prayers and support
                    from family, friends, new friends, and the Grace of God, I won that battle.
                    God is now using this experience in ways that I could never have imagined
                    bringing comfort and a voice of experience to those now fighting their 
                    own battles.
