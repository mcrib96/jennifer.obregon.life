                    After dating for several years and not even knowing about it, we got married in 2010.
                    With dozens of chaperones (often at the same time) watching, our friendship began
                    and blossomed into a family that we could never have imagined.  Throughout our time
                    together, God has been and continues to be the center of it all.  Without Him, 
                    our life would be ordinary.
                </p>
