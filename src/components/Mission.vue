                To live, as well as love and serve others, out of total dependency on the life of Christ within me.
                Through Jesus I have live and value and an unconditional "Yes" of approval by the God of Heaven.
                Nothing else is needed.

                    And I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from God's love.
                    Neither death, nor life, neither angles nor demons, neither our fears
                    for today, nor our worries about tomorrow - not even the powers of 
                    hell can separate us from God's love. Romans 8:38
